    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is also known as the coefficient of determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance of the dependent variable. The explained variance is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable, while the total variance is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",

    "In other words, R-squared represents how well the regression line fits the observed data. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, and a lower R-squared value indicates a poor fit.\n",

    "However, it is important to note that R-squared does not indicate the causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It also does not provide information about the goodness of fit of the model in predicting new observations. Therefore, R-squared should be used in conjunction with other metrics and techniques to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model."

    "Lasso regularization is a technique used in linear regression to address the problem of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures noise in the data, leading to poor performance on new data. Lasso regularization aims to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to have smaller coefficients for some of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term in Lasso regularization is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients of the independent variables, whereas in Ridge regularization, the penalty term is proportional to the square of the coefficients. This means that Lasso regularization can shrink coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating some of the independent variables from the model, whereas Ridge regularization only shrinks coefficients towards zero but never exactly to zero.\n",

    "The decision of whether to use Lasso or Ridge regularization depends on the problem being solved. If the data has a large number of independent variables and only a few of them are expected to be important in predicting the dependent variable, Lasso regularization may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if all of the independent variables are expected to be important, Ridge regularization may be more appropriate. Additionally, the choice may depend on the nature of the data and the specific goals of the analysis.\n",
