    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or software to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence to accomplish. AI can be thought of as a broad field that encompasses a range of techniques and approaches to enable machines to reason, learn, and perceive their environment. Examples of AI applications include image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: AI can be used in the healthcare industry to analyze medical records and help doctors make more accurate diagnoses. AI can also be used in the financial industry to detect fraud by analyzing large amounts of transaction data.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms on large datasets to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML algorithms learn from data and improve their performance over time without human intervention. ML can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, depending on the type of learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A spam filter that learns to classify emails as spam or not based on user feedback is an example of supervised learning. An algorithm that groups similar items together in a dataset without any prior knowledge of the categories is an example of unsupervised learning.\n",

    "Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex relationships in data. Deep learning has enabled breakthroughs in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Deep learning algorithms can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, which can be used for classification, regression, and other tasks.\n",
