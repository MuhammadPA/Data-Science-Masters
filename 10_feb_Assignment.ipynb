    "The close() function is used to close an open file. Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Releases system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates system resources such as memory and file handles to that file. Closing the file frees up these resources, allowing the operating system to allocate them to other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flushes unwritten data: When a file is opened in write mode, data is typically stored in a buffer before it is written to the file on disk. Closing the file flushes this buffer, ensuring that all data is written to the file and stored permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Prevents data corruption: If a file is not closed properly, it can cause data corruption. For example, if a file is opened for writing and the program terminates abnormally before the file is closed, the data in the buffer may not be written to the file, leading to data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Improves system stability: When a large number of files are left open, it can cause system stability problems. Closing files as soon as they are no longer needed can help prevent these problems."
