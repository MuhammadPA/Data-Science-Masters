    "In the context of artificial neural networks, an activation function refers to a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron or a layer of neurons. Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron in a neural network receives input signals, performs a weighted sum of these inputs, and then applies an activation function to the sum to produce an output. The activation function determines whether the neuron will be activated or \"fire\" based on the computed output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions serve two main purposes in neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce non-linearity: Without activation functions, the neural network would essentially be a linear model, and it would be limited to learning only linear relationships between inputs and outputs. Non-linear activation functions enable neural networks to learn and represent complex patterns and mappings in the data, making them powerful function approximators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enable the network to learn: Activation functions play a crucial role during the training process of a neural network. They introduce non-linearities that allow the network to learn from non-linear and complex data distributions. Activation functions also help in normalizing and controlling the output range of neurons, which can aid in the stability and efficiency of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commonly used activation functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sigmoid: The sigmoid function squashes the input values between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities. However, sigmoid functions suffer from saturation at extreme input values, leading to vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): The ReLU function returns the input directly if it is positive, and zero otherwise. ReLU has become a popular choice due to its simplicity and ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): The tanh function maps input values to the range of -1 to 1. It is also a non-linear function that addresses the vanishing gradient problem to some extent.\n",

    "   Tanh functions are symmetric around the origin and address the saturation issue to some extent. They are commonly used in hidden layers of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): The ReLU function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). It returns the input directly if it is positive, and zero otherwise. ReLU has gained popularity due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. It helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and accelerates training. However, ReLU can cause dead neurons or \"dying ReLU\" problem where some neurons never activate and stop learning.\n",

    "6. Exponential Linear Unit (ELU): The ELU function is a variant of ReLU that smoothly handles negative inputs by using an exponential function. It is defined as f(x) = x if x > 0, and a(e^x - 1) if x <= 0, where a is a positive constant.\n",

    "1. Non-linearity and Model Capacity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn and represent complex relationships in the data. Without non-linear activation functions, a neural network would be limited to learning only linear relationships. By introducing non-linearity, activation functions increase the model's capacity to capture and model more complex patterns and mappings.\n",

Activation functions affect the flow of gradients through the network. If gradients become too small (vanishing gradients) or too large (exploding gradients), training can become challenging or unstable. Activation functions that mitigate the vanishing gradient problem or control gradient magnitudes help stabilize and facilitate training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vanishing Gradient Problem: Some activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh, are prone to the vanishing gradient problem. In deep networks with many layers, gradients can diminish exponentially as they propagate backward, making it difficult for early layers to learn effectively. Activation functions like ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and variants help mitigate this issue by providing a non-zero gradient for positive inputs, promoting better gradient flow and more effective training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sparsity and Network Efficiency: Activation functions like ReLU result in sparsity, where a significant portion of the neurons' outputs is zero. This sparsity can lead to more efficient computations, as zero activations do not contribute to the forward or backward passes, reducing the computational burden. Sparse networks can also have regularizing effects, reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance.\n",

Functions like sigmoid and tanh map their inputs to specific ranges, which can be useful for specific tasks like binary classification or ensuring bounded outputs. Normalizing the output range of neurons can promote stable learning and prevent saturation issues.\n",

This can cause the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients diminish significantly during backpropagation, making it challenging for early layers to learn.\n",

By optimizing the cross-entropy loss, the model learns to assign higher probabilities to the correct classes and lower probabilities to the incorrect ones.\n",
