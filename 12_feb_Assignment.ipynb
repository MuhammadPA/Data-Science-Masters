    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are raised when an error condition occurs that the program cannot handle. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the program jumps to the nearest exception handler. This allows you to catch and handle exceptions in your code, which can help to make your programs more robust and less prone to crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language, while exceptions occur during the execution of the code. Syntax errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running, and they are usually caused by mistakes in the code such as misspelled keywords, incorrect indentation, or mismatched parentheses. On the other hand, exceptions are caused by events that occur during the execution of the program, such as division by zero, file not found, or network errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, syntax errors are problems with the structure of the code, while exceptions are problems with the runtime behavior of the code."
