    "A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is designed to store and organize data so that it can be retrieved quickly and efficiently. Databases are used in various applications, including e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases use the relational model, while NoSQL databases use different data models such as key-value, document, column-family, or graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more scalable than SQL databases because they can easily distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: NoSQL databases are more flexible than SQL databases because they do not have a fixed schema, and data can be added or removed without the need for a database schema change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying: SQL databases use SQL for querying data, which is a standardized language for relational databases. NoSQL databases use different query languages for different data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID compliance: SQL databases are generally ACID-compliant, which means that they ensure data consistency, while NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: SQL databases are often used for enterprise applications that require complex querying and transactions. NoSQL databases are often used for web applications and big data analytics that require scalability and flexibility."
