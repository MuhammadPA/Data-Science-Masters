This can result in poor generalization performance, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The consequence of overfitting is that the model is too complex and has learned to memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns.\n",

    "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. This can result in poor performance on both the training and test data. The consequence of underfitting is that the model is not complex enough to learn the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

Examples of high bias models include linear regression models with few features or high regularization, or decision trees with a small depth.\n",

    "1.L1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model weights to the loss function. This results in sparse models, where many of the model weights are set to zero, effectively removing unimportant features from the model. L1 regularization is often used in feature selection or in models where interpretability is important.\n",

L2 regularization is often used in linear regression models and can help prevent overfitting by reducing the impact of noisy or irrelevant features.\n",

    "3.Dropout Regularization: Dropout regularization randomly drops out some of the neurons in the model during training. This forces the model to learn more robust and redundant representations, preventing it from relying too heavily on any particular set of features. Dropout regularization is often used in neural network models and can be applied to both fully connected and convolutional layers.\n",
