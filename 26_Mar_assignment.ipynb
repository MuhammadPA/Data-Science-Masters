    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning for finding the optimal parameters (weights and biases) of a model by minimizing a cost function. The cost function is a measure of how well the model fits the training data and is typically defined as the difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",

    "The basic idea of gradient descent is to iteratively adjust the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function. The steepest descent is the direction that leads to the fastest reduction in the cost function.

The parameters are then updated based on the gradient of the current example. This process is repeated for all the training examples in a random order, or until the cost function reaches a minimum.\n",

    "Multicollinearity is a common issue that can occur in multiple linear regression when there is a high correlation between two or more independent variables. It occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to determine the separate effects of each variable on the dependent variable. In other words, it becomes difficult to determine the unique contribution of each independent variable to the dependent variable.\n",

    "Multicollinearity can cause several problems in a multiple regression model. It can make the coefficients of the independent variables unstable, meaning that small changes in the data can lead to large changes in the coefficients. It can also reduce the accuracy of the coefficient estimates and increase the standard error of the coefficients, making it difficult to determine the significance of each variable.\n",

    "2.Variance inflation factor (VIF): Calculate the VIF for each independent variable. VIF is a measure of the degree of multicollinearity in the model. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 is an indication of multicollinearity.\n",

    "3.Eigenvalues: Calculate the eigenvalues for the correlation matrix. If any of the eigenvalues are close to zero, this indicates the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
