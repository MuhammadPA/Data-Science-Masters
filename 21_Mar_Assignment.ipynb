    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to encode categorical variables as numerical variables. However, there is a subtle difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables that have a natural ordering. For example, suppose we have a variable \"education level\" with categories \"high school\", \"some college\", \"bachelor's degree\", \"master's degree\", and \"doctorate\". In this case, we can assign a numerical value to each category based on their relative order. For example, we can encode \"high school\" as 1, \"some college\" as 2, \"bachelor's degree\" as 3, \"master's degree\" as 4, and \"doctorate\" as 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, on the other hand, is a technique used to encode categorical variables that do not have a natural ordering. In this case, we simply assign a numerical value to each category. For example, suppose we have a variable \"city\" with categories \"New York\", \"Chicago\", and \"Los Angeles\". In this case, we can encode \"New York\" as 1, \"Chicago\" as 2, and \"Los Angeles\" as 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we would choose ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has a natural ordering, such as \"education level\". This allows the model to capture the relative importance or hierarchy between the categories. On the other hand, we would choose label encoding when the categorical variable does not have a natural ordering, such as \"city\". In this case, we simply want to represent each category with a unique numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example in Python of how we can implement ordinal encoding and label encoding using the OrdinalEncoder and LabelEncoder classes from the sklearn.preprocessing module:"

If the covariance is zero, then there is no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
